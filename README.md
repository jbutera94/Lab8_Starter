## Check Your Understanding Questions
1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why <br>
(1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. Because everyone can get the shared code and be able to check if they all get same test results. 

2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? <br>
No, because unit tests check the output of a function is correct, while end to end tests check the UI functionality.
